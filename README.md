# Platforming game (Final Project)
## Michael Villafranca for CSCI_3317 Computer Game Programming: April 2021
### Description:
This is my final project for the computer game programming course that I took.
The game has a few types of blocks that the player sprite interacts with to behave
like a platforming game. Unfortunetly I couldn't get the jump to work correctly as
intended, but later was informed by my professor during my final presentation 
that I could simulate gravity better for a jump mechanic with GetTickCount().
Besides that everything went as planned for this project.

This application was developed on Visual Studio using C++ and DirectX.
